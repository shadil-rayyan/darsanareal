          Support To Society: With the objective of supporting the community we
          are in, a School at Kolar Gold Fields that requires our intervention
          was visited by Com. Arunan, Vineeth VS and Sathian in June 2022. This
          School has Pre-Primary, Primary and Secondary classes. The students
          are from poor backgrounds. They are the children of daily wagers of
          the area. The school is supported by the CPM for its operation. The
          number of teachers is less than the number of the classes/divisions.
          The salary for the teachers is very low and is not paid regularly.
          There is no support up to 7th standard from the government, and the
          school is managed with the meagre fees of Rs.200/ month received from
          students. Bangalore chapter started the support for the school in
          Nov-2022. Initially, we set up a library and sports equipment for the
          children. Major support provided on an ongoing basis is the salary for
          two teachers (12000/-), textbooks and notebooks for students during
          the start of the academic year, awards to students for sports and arts
          competitions, etc. Our team provides guidance on improving the quality
          of teaching as well. Also, with support from the US chapter, we are
          providing egg supplements to all primary school children. We have
          conducted three visits during the year to discuss the progress,
          conduct workshops and attend the award Ceremony.

          Darsana Job Portal: The main objective of the portal is to help
          Darsana members to find a job or to move to better roles and jobs. The
          portal provides a single platform to pool all the job requirements
          known to Darsana members across the globe. Com. Krishnakumar
          inaugurated the job portal on 8th January 2022. It was well received
          initially, and our members have put up several job openings.
          Gradually, the use of the portal showed a downtrend. In the coming
          year, we must brainstorm and take corrective actions to re-energise
          the platform. The job portal was designed and realized under the
          leadership of Com. Ajith Prasad, Com. Jose Varghese and Com. Arjun K P

          Career Explorer Talk: An online expert panel discussion was conducted
          to guide engineering students in choosing their career paths after
          completing their Degrees. This was open to all Engineering students
          across Kerala. It was planned as a series of sessions to cover all the
          engineering branches. The first in this series, “Career Paths in IT”,
          was conducted on 22 Jan 2022. The Panelists were Com. Mukundan
          Annamalai, Com. ArunanThayyil and Com. Dinesh I. The other sessions
          planned in the series were put on hold as the student crowd's
          participation was not as high as expected. An analysis following the
          first session indicated that student communities, in general, are not
          giving priority to such webinars.
